# Simple DE Solver
Second order differential equation solver that uses FEM with Galerkin method.
## Details
See FEM.pdf for more details - explanation of a code and the specyfic example of DE that the program solves.
## Potential improvements
* Implementing tridiagonal https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridiagonal_matrix_algorithm (now the solver uses standard np.linglang.solve)
